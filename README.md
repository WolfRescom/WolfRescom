# Hi there, I'm Kunal 👋

I'm a third-year student at the **University of Texas at Austin**, where I'm pursuing a **B.S. in Computer Science**, a **B.A. in Mathematics**, and a **Minor in Business**.

I'm passionate about building intelligent and scalable systems. My primary interests lie in **Artificial Intelligence**, especially **Generative AI**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Computer Vision**. I'm also an experienced full-stack developer and open-source contributor.
