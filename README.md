# Hi there, I'm Kunal 👋



[cite_start]I'm a third-year student at the **University of Texas at Austin** [cite: 3][cite_start], where I'm pursuing a **B.S. in Computer Science**, a **B.A. in Mathematics**, and a **Minor in Business**[cite: 5].

I'm passionate about building intelligent and scalable systems. [cite_start]My primary interests lie in **Artificial Intelligence**, especially **Generative AI** [cite: 13][cite_start], **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** [cite: 13][cite_start], and **Computer Vision**[cite: 13, 24]. I'm also an experienced full-stack developer and open-source contributor.
