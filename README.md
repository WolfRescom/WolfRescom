# Hi there, I'm Kunal 👋

I'm a third-year student at the **University of Texas at Austin**, where I'm pursuing a **B.S. in Computer Science**, a **B.A. in Mathematics**, and a **Minor in Business**.

I'm passionate about building intelligent and scalable systems. My primary interests lie in **Artificial Intelligence**, especially **Generative AI**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Computer Vision**. I'm also an experienced full-stack developer and open-source contributor.

### 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

* 🔬 Conducting research on pedestrian trajectory prediction as an **Undergraduate Researcher** at the **Living with Robots Lab @ UT Austin**.
* 💾 Contributing to the **Intel OpenVINO** toolkit, implementing PyTorch operations in C++ and integrating new models to expand quantization support.
* 🏆 Competing in the **eBay ML Challenge**, where I built a Top 3 nationally-ranked NER model for aspect extraction from product listings.
* 🤝 Co-founding and developing **FundFlow**, a MERN-stack application to track and search university budget data.

### 🌟 Featured Projects

Here are a few of my favorite projects. Check out my repositories for more!

1.  **[ChitChatCode.com](https://github.com/WolfRescom/ChitChatCode)**
    * A full-stack AI application that lets developers query GitHub repositories using natural language.
    * Built a scalable RAG pipeline using LangChain, Hugging Face embeddings, and ChromaDB.
    * Deployed on AWS (EC2, FastAPI, Postgres) serving 500+ queries/day with low latency.

2.  **[miniGPT](https://github.com/WolfRescom/miniGPT)**
    * A complete rebuild of the GPT-2 (124M) model from scratch in PyTorch on the OpenWebText dataset.
    * Demonstrates deep expertise in decoder-only transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, and large-scale model training.

3.  **[eBay ML Challenge - Aspect Extraction](https://github.com/WolfRescom/ebay-ml-challenge)**
    * Achieved a **Top 3 National** placement by building a multi-head NER model for 2M+ product listings.
    * Improved F1/recall for rare entities by 15% using LLM-powered data augmentation and domain-adaptive pre-training.
